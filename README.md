### Udacity's IPND Project Assignment
#### Lesson 06: Front-End Development

## Project Overview
- The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- Building a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).
##What's in it to Learn?
The memory game presents an opportunity to fully combine skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project. Aside from solidifying those skills with these three technologies, discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

The following are just some of the questions that you'll experience along the way:

 - What's the ideal workflow?
 - How many files do I need?
 - Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
 - How many JavaScript functions do I need?
 - Should my function be this many lines of code?

There's no one right answer to each question. The answers to these questions will come up while working on the project.

## How The Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different colors on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the colors face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

####**Each turn**
The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying color.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same color.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

####**Game Functionality**
The real-life game, players flip over cards to locate the pairs that match The goal is to recreate this effect in your project. There are a couple of interactions that you'll need to handle:

**Flipping cards**
What happens when cards match
What happens when cards do not match
When the game finishes

## Getting the Project's Code

In order to run the Project you need to:
1. Download the Project's files
2. Run the html file (index.html) in your browser
3. Play the GAME

In order to get the code for the project, just clone or download it. 
 You can then modify it to fit your own likings and set your own games.
